It’s not that I didn’t care about him, it’s that I care for myself more. /*p break */        One night, I was listening to this young man, Trent Shelton who has since become motivational coach. He said, protect your peace.  It made so much sense.  All of a sudden, it dawned on me… and keeping the peace was replaced by protecting it. /*p break */        Don’t allow yourself to be subjected to anyone who doesn’t bring out the best in you.  Keep your circle small and only surround yourself with people who truly love you.  Stop making excuses for other people.  If they bring you down more than up, let them go. /*p break */        Keep your peace. /*p break */        That’s what I’m doing now.  I really do have some of the most amazing friends in my circle.  Several small circles of people who love me, support me, bring out the best in me, encourage me, and inspire me.  If this one guy can’t be a part of that, then it’s not the right fit. /*p break */        To get through the lonely times of being single, I put less value on romantic love and more value on the love of my friends and family. /*p break */        Protect your peace the way you would your flower garden, and watch how beautiful it will grow."

I was on vacation in Montezuma, Costa Rica. We went zip lining, and once we got up high enough, we were led to this waterfall. It was one of those, once in a lifetime moments. Aside from a little anxiety, I was ready for my first jump at the young age of 52. Strong legs and a solid core got me soaring off of that cliff. Keep at your routine. No matter what your fitness goals are because you never know what challenge you may face."

        contents: "“If you want to live a happy life, tie it to a goal, not to people or things.” ― Albert Einstein. I am a junkie for a good inspirational quote.  This quote has been my mantra for the past few weeks. How many days have I pined away over the way someone is treating me.  Even while it’s happening I know what I’m really doing is procrastinating my list of things to do. It is so true, that the mind thinks it’s being productive while problem solving.  But how to quit all that mumbo jumbo that repeatedly cycles and loops through the mind? Grieving is natural and acceptable.  We grieve over things not going our way often, for loss of people who have passed or who chose to leave us. We grieve over the machines we rely on when we they break down and every time we turn on the news. The choice we need to make is how long should we suffer?  Make a decision to grieve or not, but know that you are giving this decision a lot of power and energy that could go towards something great, like writing your novel, going for a long walk, cooking a fantastic meal for your favorite people, or painting your living room a new color. It’s hard to stop the grieving and worrying so ween yourself a little each day. Today I’ll allow myself to think about this problem for 30 minutes, tomorrow 25 minutes and each day shave five minutes off until you’re done .And if you still miss that worrying, only do it five minutes a day.Go outside and weed the yard, plant a flower, and most importantly find something to smile about."
